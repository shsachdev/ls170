The Transcription Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the corner-stones of the
Internet. One of the key characteristics of this protocol is the fact that it
provides reliable data transfer.

What TCP essentially provides is the abstraction of reliable network
communication on top of an unreliable channel.

The services that TCP provides makes it the protocol of choice for many networked
applications.

# TCP Segments

Segments are the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) of TCP. Like the PDUs of protocols
we've looked at for other network layers, it uses a combination of headers and
payload to provide encapsulation of data from the layer above.
