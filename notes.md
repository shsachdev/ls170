What is a network?

At the most basic level, it's two devices connected in such a way that they can
communicate or exchange data.

Routers are network devices that can route network traffic to other networks.

Within a Local Area Network, they effectively act as gateways into and out of
the network.

# Protocols

If we zoomed into the vast network of networks that is the internet, we'd see
that it's made up of a huge array of disparate components.

There are countless different types of device that can connect to the internet,
from laptops, tablets, and phones, to kettles, toasters, and lightbulbs

We can think of a protocol as a system of rules. In terms of computer networks,
we can be a bit more specific:

A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data.

There are numerous different protocols that are used to communicate over the
internet. A short list of some of the most widely used protocols might include
the following:

- IP
- SMTP
- TCP
- HTTP
- Ethernet
- FTP
- DNS
- UDP
- TLS

You might be wondering why there are so many different protocols for network
communication. Two reasons for this:

- Different protocols were developed to address different aspects of network
communication.
- Different protocols were developed to address the same aspect of network
communication, but in a different way or for a specific use-case.

# Protocols for different aspects of communication

To ensure that a particular message is understood, we need to order the words
within that message in a certain order. We can think of this word order as part
of the *syntactical rules* that govern the *structure of the message*.

A different aspect of communication might be the flow and order of all the
messages in the conversation. For example, speaking in turn rather than both
at the same time. We can maybe think of these as *message transfer rules* for how
speech is conducted.

# Different Protocols for the Same Aspect of Communication
